The hardware design of this version is open-source and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/canokeys/canokey-stm32). **Please note that this version cannot provide any security assurances; anyone with access to the device can obtain the plaintext keys.**
* **CanoKey nRF52**: This version has never been sold and is only for development testing. It uses the nRF52840 chip, and various USB devices based on this chip are easily available.
